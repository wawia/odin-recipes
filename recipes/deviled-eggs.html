    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 ounces prepared Mexican street corn dip</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crumbled cotija cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon slivered red onion</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili-lime seasoning, such as Tajin® Clásico Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Cut eggs in half lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Remove yolks to a small mixing bowl; mash with a fork. Add in Mexican street corn dip, mayonnaise, and lime juice. Stir together with a fork until fairly smooth; stir in 2 teaspoons of cotija cheese.</li>
        <li>Fit a piping bag with a coupler and a tip with a fairly large opening. Drop piping bag into a tall glass and fold edges down around the glass. Spoon egg yolk filling into the bag. Gather edges and twist together. Pipe filling into egg whites. Alternately, spoon filling into a resealable plastic bag, press to remove excess air, and reseal. Cut one corner of bag off, and pipe filling into egg whites. Or, simply spoon filling into egg whites.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining cotija cheese over eggs; scatter on onion slivers and cilantro. Sprinkle with Tajin® seasoning and serve.</li>
